# ***PRACTICA*** *Version Spec*

## ***VERSIONING SCHEME:***
*MAJOR_VERSION.BACKWARDS_BREAK.FEATURE_ADDED.BUG_FIX_OR_CHANGE*

**MAJOR_VERSION** = Major version. Just a number that increments at really big events (ex. at a complete re-write or big changes)

**BACKWARDS_BREAK** = If something in the new version makes it so that you can't use the application the same way you did before (ex. if feature was removed) [SemVer Major]

**FEATURE_ADDED** = If a feature or functionality was added [SemVer Minor]

**BUG_FIX_OR_CHANGE** = If a bug got fixed or if there was a small change(ex. if there was a typo in a label) [SemVer patch]
